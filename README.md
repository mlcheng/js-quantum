# js-quantum

Quantum.js is your hyper minimal aid to developing a web application. Weighing in at only *13kb*, Quantum will deliver the results you expect without getting in the way.

## Features
Quantum.js has many features you would expect to find in a JavaScript framework. Usage will not be detailed here; please see each module for detailed documentation. Quantum's modules are listed in alphabetical order below.

### [Data Binding](https://github.com/mlcheng/js-binding)
Data binding is arguably the most important part of a front-end developer's toolbox. Data binding in Quantum is done through familiar handlebar syntax, and values can be bound to any HTML property.

### [Drag Drop](https://github.com/mlcheng/js-dragdrop)
Using only one line, you can set a drop target on your page to receive files from the end-user.

### [History](https://github.com/mlcheng/js-history)
Managing application state is a tough task to do, yet it is highly expected in the age of Single Page Applications (SPA). Setup application states and their controllers, and let Quantum handle the rest for you!

### [HTTP](https://github.com/mlcheng/js-http)
The Quantum HTTP module aims to make HTTP requests as easy and painless as possible. Simple requests can be made in one line, or if other customization is desired, the request builder can be used.

### [Template](https://github.com/mlcheng/js-template)
Include a file's content inside any HTML tag. Great for modularization!

### [Test](https://github.com/mlcheng/js-test)
What's a good library without a good testing framework? Quantum's testing framework is no-nonsense. Just `expect()` something `toBe()` something. And you're done.

### [Toast](https://github.com/mlcheng/js-toast)
One of the first Quantum modules. With just one line, you can show a beautiful toast notification like you see on Android. With a few more lines, you can customize the toast to your heart's desire.

### [Snackbar](https://github.com/mlcheng/js-snackbar)
Even unminified, snackbar is only 2.5kb. Snackbar extends toast.js using object oriented JavaScript to display a beautiful snackbar notification, also like what you see on Android.
